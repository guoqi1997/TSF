🚩 2017: Recurrent neural networks ([RNNs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/036402139090002E)), such as [DA-RNN](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0366.pdf) and [MQRNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11053), emerged as the dominant approach, marking the beginning of rapid advancement of deep learning in TSF.

🚩 2018: Data in various fields exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies, and graph neural networks ([GNNs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4700287)) have introduced novel perspectives for spatiotemporal modeling, with [STGCN](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0505.pdf) widely adopted as a benchmark. 

🚩 2019: [Transformer](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)-based models , such as [LogTrans](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/6775a0635c302542da2c32aa19d86be0-Paper.pdf) and [TFT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021000637), have gained popularity due to their strength in modeling global dependencies. Concurrently, convolutional neural networks ([CNNs](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1181/)) (e.g., [DeepGLO](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/3a0844cee4fcf57de0c71e9ad3035478-Paper.pdf), [MICN](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zt53IDUR1U)) were employed in TSF, leveraging their parallelism, parameter sharing, and local perception capabilities. 

🚩 2020: Multi-layer perceptrons ([MLPs](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-09865-001)), due to their simple architecture and ease of implementation, have been widely applied in TSF. A representative example is [N-BEATS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437), which inspired a series of follow-up variants such as [NBEATSx](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207022000413) and [NHiTS](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/25854).

🚩 2021: Given that time series forecasting can essentially be regarded as a generative task, some generative approaches, such as [TimeGrad](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/rasul21a/rasul21a.pdf) and [MAF](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WiGQBFuVRv), model the underlying data distribution to generate future sequences. 

🚩 2022: The Transformer architecture has undergone continuous development in recent years, giving rise to numerous studies, including [FEDformer](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/zhou22g/zhou22g.pdf) and [Pyraformer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0EXmFzUn5I). 

🚩 2023: [DLinear](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26317), a model based purely on MLPs, argued that Transformers are not necessarily superior in TSF and asserted that linear neural networks might be equally effective. 

🚩 2024: [iTransformer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JePfAI8fah) demonstrated the effectiveness of the Transformer architecture through structural optimization, providing a strong rebuttal to DLinear's claims. Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of methods based on large language models (LLMs), such as [Time-LLM](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Unb5CVPtae), provides further evidence for the feasibility of Transformers in TSF.

📍 We provide a systematic review of deep learning-based TSF methods, summarizing recent advancements.  Specifically, we propose **a novel taxonomy based on core modeling paradigms**, which categorizes existing methods into three paradigms: **discriminative, generative, and plug-and-play**. Additionally, we summarize commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss current challenges and future research directions in this field.
