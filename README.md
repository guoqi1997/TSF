🚩 2017: Recurrent neural networks ([RNNs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/036402139090002E)), such as [DA-RNN](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0366.pdf) and [MQRNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11053), emerged as the dominant approach, marking the beginning of rapid advancement of deep learning in TSF.

🚩 2018: Data in various fields exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies, and graph neural networks (GNNs)\cite{gnn} have introduced novel perspectives for spatiotemporal modeling, with STGCN\cite{stgcn} widely adopted as a benchmark. 

🚩 2019: Transformer-based models \cite{transformer}, such as LogTrans~\cite{logtrans} and TFT~\cite{tft}, have gained popularity due to their strength in modeling global dependencies. Concurrently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) \cite{cnn} (e.g., DeepGLO~\cite{deepglo}, MICN~\cite{micn}) were employed in TSF, leveraging their parallelism, parameter sharing, and local perception capabilities. 

🚩 2020: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), due to their simple architecture and ease of implementation, have been widely applied in TSF. A representative example is N-BEATS~\cite{n-beats}, which inspired a series of follow-up variants such as NBEATSx~\cite{nbeatsx} and N-HiTS~\cite{nhits}.

🚩 2021: Given that time series forecasting can essentially be regarded as a generative task, some generative approaches, such as TimeGrad~\cite{timegrad} and MAF~\cite{maf}, model the underlying data distribution to generate future sequences. 

🚩 2022: The Transformer architecture has undergone continuous development in recent years, giving rise to numerous studies, including FEDformer~\cite{fedformer} and Pyraformer~\cite{pyraformer}. 

🚩 2023: DLinear~\cite{dlinear}, a model based purely on MLPs, argued that Transformers are not necessarily superior in TSF and asserted that linear neural networks might be equally effective. 

🚩 2024: iTransformer~\cite{itransformer} demonstrated the effectiveness of the Transformer architecture through structural optimization, providing a strong rebuttal to DLinear's claims. Furthermore, the rapid proliferation of methods based on large language models (LLMs), such as Time-LLM~\cite{time-llm}, provides further evidence for the feasibility of Transformers in TSF.

📍 We provide a systematic review of deep learning-based TSF methods, summarizing recent advancements.  Specifically, we propose **a novel taxonomy based on core modeling paradigms**, which categorizes existing methods into three paradigms: **discriminative, generative, and plug-and-play**. Additionally, we summarize commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss current challenges and future research directions in this field.
